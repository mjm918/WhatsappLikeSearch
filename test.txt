Like adolescents coping with awkward changes to their bodies, the iPhone 7
due for release on Friday, introduces some uncomfortable transitions. They include the much ballyhooed removal of the
headphone jack and the replacement of the physical home button with a virtual one
For Apple customers, this creates a difficult choice. While upgrading iPhones in the past was typically a no-brainer
now people must wrestle with whether to deal with the hassle of having no audio jack. Many people could simply upgrade to
last year’s model, the iPhone 6S, which is also a fast phone with great cameras and still has the jack
Yet after testing the new iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the 7 Plus, for five days, I have hopped on the 7 train
While it is irritating not to have an audio jack — Apple nixed the 3.5 millimeter port to make room for faster chips
better batteries and to make the iPhone water-resistant — and the older physical home button feels better to press than the new virtual one,
the new iPhones deliver on Apple’s promises.
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are tremendously fast — more than double the speed of the two-year-old iPhone 6 — and their cameras
produce superb, vivid photos. The battery life is improved, and the iPhones survived water torture tests.
And after a while, I didn’t miss the headphone jack as much as I thought. Apple is pushing people toward
wireless earphones with the introduction of AirPods, its first wireless earbuds, which I tried. I found AirPods to
be a decent first attempt at wireless audio, though there were glitches.

The bottom line: Those who have been waiting years to buy a new phone are in store for a major upgrade with the iPhone 7.
Why you don’t need a jack
When rumors surfaced about the iPhone 7, they centered on Apple’s omission of the decades-old headphone jack,
one of the longest surviving technology standards. The now-discontinued port let consumers plug many accessories in,
including speakers, earphones and credit card readers. Now the new iPhones have only one port for hooking up accessories:
Apple’s proprietary Lightning connector that was traditionally used for charging the iPhone’s battery.
Apple understood that parting with the audio jack would be painful. So it made two moves:
1) The new iPhones include a converter, or a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone,
and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in an audio accessory.
2) Also included in the box: A pair of wired earbuds with a Lightning connector.
For iPhone owners who relied on Apple’s included earbuds, the Lightning earbuds solve that problem.
But for consumers hoarding lots of wired audio gear, the converter solution is less convenient since the adapter is tiny and easy to lose.
If you have a pair of great wired headphones, your best bet is to leave the converter connected to the headphones so you don’t forget it.
The most convenient workaround to not having a headphone jack is to make the leap to wireless earphones.
Apple’s wireless AirPods, due for release in October, cost $159 and come in a box that resembles a dental-floss dispenser.
They connect to the iPhone’s Bluetooth connection via a proprietary chip in the earphones, called W1.
This makes setting AirPods up extremely easy: When you open the box next to the iPhone,
the earphones automatically pair with the device. (The box also charges AirPods.) From there, you simply
put the earphones on and start listening to music or podcasts; removing the earphones causes the audio to pause.
Here is where AirPods fell short for me: Sometimes when listening to podcasts, a glitch caused the podcasts to
rewind and replay a small segment — an eerie echo. In addition, when using AirPods outside, there was occasional interference,
causing the audio to crackle and cut out.
An Apple spokeswoman said the company was looking into the podcast issue, adding that the AirPods
I tested were early hardware and that bugs should be resolved by the time they are released next month.
Over all, AirPods sound decent, with loud bass and clear audio quality, comparable to the wired earbuds that
Apple has included in iPhones for years. They aren’t, however, sufficient for drowning out the thunderous prattle of a loud co-worker.
While AirPods do a good job staying in your ears, they look odd, like dangling short white stubs.
They evoked mockery from one of my editors, who said, “Cigarettes belong in your mouth, not your ears, Brian.”
sharp speed increase. Spurred by faster chips, everything — switching between apps, opening the camera — feels snappier.
The iPhone 7 battery also gets about two hours more juice than the 6S.
Using the app Geekbench 4, I tested the speeds of the iPhone 7, 6S and 6. The iPhone 7 was 39 percent
faster than the 6S and 114 percent faster than the 6. So people who bought the 6S last year can probably skip upgrading to the 7,
but those holding onto a 6 and anything older will benefit from a tremendous performance gain.
Apple also improved the iPhone cameras. Like the 6S devices, the iPhone 7 devices carry 12-megapixel sensors.
The difference is that both the new iPhones include optical image stabilization, a feature that helps photos remain
clear even when your hands are shaky. The larger model, the 7 Plus, also includes a second camera on the back. The two
cameras work together to show the photo’s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background.
In my tests comparing photos taken with the iPhone 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as a competitor, Samsung’s Galaxy S7,
photos taken with the 7 Plus had noticeably better detail when reviewed on a large computer monitor. But when reviewing
photos taken with each camera side by side on a smaller smartphone screen, the differences were negligible.
So while the new iPhones have great cameras, I wouldn’t let that drive your buying decision.
If you prefer a larger screen for reading and watching videos, consider the 7 Plus, but if you prefer something easier to
carry in a pocket and type on using one hand, go for the 7. (The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.)
Lastly, Apple made changes to the new iPhones to improve durability. The iPhones are designed to be water-resistant.
In my tests, they survived a swim in a water pitcher. The physical home button was replaced with a force-sensitive virtual one.
It remains to be seen if the new home button will be more durable. In the past, one of the first components to wear out on older
iPhones was the home button.
Bottom Line
There are two types of tech consumers: Those who upgrade on a fairly regular cycle (about every two years with smartphones)
to embrace new technology, and those who upgrade only when they feel they need to.
If you’re in the former camp and own an iPhone that is at least two years old, the decision is obvious: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
are great upgrades. But if you just bought the iPhone 6S last year, the improvements will be incremental, and you may want to
save your money for the next iPhone.
If you’re in the latter group, it’s a tougher question. If you have, say, the four-year-old iPhone 5, you will see a great
improvement with an iPhone 6S or a 7. Your decision may come down to how much the lack of a headphone jack and physical home button bothers you. Audiophiles with lots of wired accessories, for example, may find using a converter too inconvenient.
But taking the leap to the 7 may be a wise bet, even for late technology adopters. Apple is likely to continue making iPhones
without headphone jacks, and next year’s iPhone will have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen,
according to two people at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because the product details are private.
Apple declined to comment on next year’s iPhones.
To compete with Apple, rivals may also eliminate the audio jack to make room for faster processors, better batteries
and more durable parts. (A little-known fact: Lenovo beat Apple to removing the audio jack in its new smartphone, Moto
Z, released this year.)
Sooner or later, consumers will probably look back at the iPhone’s puberty phase and accept that changes had to be made
for the smartphone to mature. I, for one, am looking forward to a future with fewer wires.
Correction: September 13, 2016
An earlier version of this article misstated a difference between the 6S devices and the iPhone 7 devices.
Both of the iPhone 7 models will have optical image stabilization, as opposed to only one of the 6S models.
It is not the case that neither of the 6S models had the feature.
Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are faster, feature significantly better cameras, feature a new solid state Home button and Taptic Engine,
introduce Wide Color and other major Retina HD technology.
The phone is also fully splash, dust and waterproof, which is an evolution from the iPhone 6s, which is only partially water-resistant.
The headphone jack also disappeared and was replaced with a second speaker for surround sound. The device also saw the addition of a a
pressure-sensitive surface with haptic feedback.
Apple kept its standard two-model offering for 2016, sticking with 4.7- and 5.5-inch screen sizes. Two new color finish options were
also introduced: a solid matte Black and a high gloss Jet Black. Rumors circulated in November 2016 by Japanese site Macotakara citing
supply chain sources said that Apple is planning to also add a "Jet White" color option. They did suggest that the information could be
unreliable and didn't have a timeframe for when the change would be introduced.
On March 21, Apple introduced a (Product)Red color option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, alongside other product refreshes.
As with other (Red) products, sales of this particular color of iPhone will help raise money to support HIV/AIDS programs, providing
counselling, testing, and medicine that prevent the transmission of HIV.
The new iPhone 7 models introduce a new solid-state (non-mechanical) Home button which no longer physically depresses but instead is a
software-driven sensor. That means a new physical button sequence to hard-reset the device is now holding the Volume Down and Wake buttons
for five seconds.
Apple has greatly enhanced the visible characteristics of its iPhone 7 Retina HD displays. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus feature radically
enhanced displays with very high contrast ratios, very low reflectance and peak brightness levels above 700 nits.
Apple has dropped the analog headphone jack in the iPhone 7 models. Wireless AirPods (which won't be available until October) have been
released, and Apple’s Beats subsidiary now has three families of wireless headphones to choose from.
iPhone 7 models also introduce new built-in stereo speakers, one in the base and the other in the earpiece. This generates twice
the volume for listening to music, watching videos, playing games or using on speakerphone.
Apple introduced a new system-on-chip design in 2016 dubbed the A10. The A10 Fusion chip is so efficient you get an
extra hour or two of battery.
Apple's Taptic Engine is now both greatly enlarged over the previous year's design (as shown below in the iFixit teardown) and enhanced
to provide much more accurate and precise patterns of rumbling vibration feedback, referred to haptics.
The 7 Plus features a dual camera system that enables users to shoot in both a standard wide angle as well as with a zoom feature and a
novel mode for capturing dramatic portraits.
Both iPhone 7 models incorporate a variety of other camera enhancements, from a higher resolution front facing FaceTime camera to a
rear shooter with a larger aperture and bigger pixels for better capturing detail in poorly lit settings, a particular weakness among mobile cameras.
To handle extra processing requirements the 7 Plus is sporting 3G of RAM, up from the 2GB allotted to the iPhone 6s.
Internal storage has increased to a maximum offering of 256GB for both models, double the iPhone 6 options. The baseline storage also
increased to 32GB, catching up with the rest of the smartphone industry.
On the surface, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus devices don't look much different from the previous-generation iPhone 6s
and iPhone 6s Plus, continuing to feature the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes and the same dimensions, but there are a few visual
differences and several important internal changes.
Antenna bands no longer span across the back of the devices, for a cleaner, sleeker look, and there are new colors being sold alongside
the standard Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold shades: a matte black color Apple is just calling "Black" and a new "Jet Black" with a high-gloss finish.
Most notably when it comes to design, the body of the iPhone 7 has been reengineered to be IP67 dust and water resistant, so it can hold up
to splashes, rain, and brief submersion in water. Apple's warranty doesn't cover water damage, though, so it's best to be cautious
with water exposure.
